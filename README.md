# AI Learning Hub

A comprehensive repository for learning artificial intelligence concepts, techniques, and applications. This repository covers the major domains of AI including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.

## Structure

The repository is organized into four main domains:

- **Machine Learning**: Classic machine learning algorithms and techniques
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks and deep learning architectures
- **Computer Vision**: Image and video analysis techniques
- **Natural Language Processing**: Text and language processing methods

## Getting Started

Each domain has its own directory with:
- Jupyter notebooks containing tutorials
- Python modules for implementation
- Example datasets
- README files with domain-specific information

## Requirements

Each domain has its own `requirements.txt` file listing the necessary dependencies. In general, you'll need:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- Domain-specific libraries

## Learning Path

Recommended learning path for beginners:
1. Start with Machine Learning fundamentals
2. Proceed to Deep Learning concepts
3. Explore specialized applications in Computer Vision or NLP
