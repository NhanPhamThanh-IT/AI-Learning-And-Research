# Logistic Regression Tutorial

This directory contains a comprehensive tutorial on Logistic Regression, including theory, implementation, and practical applications.

## Overview

Logistic Regression is a statistical model used for binary classification problems. Despite its name, it's a classification algorithm rather than regression. This tutorial provides an in-depth exploration of logistic regression concepts, implementation approaches, evaluation metrics, and practical applications.

## Contents

1. **Jupyter Notebook**: `05_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`
   - Comprehensive theoretical explanation
   - Step-by-step implementation examples
   - Visualizations and model evaluation

2. **Python Modules**:
   - `data.py`: Data generation, loading, and preprocessing functions
   - `model.py`: Logistic regression model implementation
   - `main.py`: Entry point for running the complete analysis pipeline

## Learning Objectives

By completing this tutorial, you will:
- Understand the mathematical foundation of logistic regression
- Learn how to implement logistic regression from scratch using gradient descent
- Know how to use scikit-learn for efficient implementation
- Be able to evaluate binary classification models using appropriate metrics
- Gain practical experience with feature engineering for classification
- Understand the assumptions and limitations of logistic regression

## Key Concepts

1. **Logistic Function (Sigmoid)**:
   - σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
   - Maps any real value to a value between 0 and 1

2. **Model Representation**:
   - z = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ
   - P(y=1) = σ(z)

3. **Decision Boundary**:
   - Linear: β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ = 0
   - Can be non-linear through feature transformation

4. **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**:
   - Logistic regression uses the principle of maximum likelihood
   - Cost function: J(θ) = -1/m * Σ [y * log(h(x)) + (1-y) * log(1-h(x))]

5. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - ROC Curve and AUC
   - Confusion Matrix

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with NumPy and Matplotlib
