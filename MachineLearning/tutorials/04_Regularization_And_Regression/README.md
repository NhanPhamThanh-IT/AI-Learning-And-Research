# Regularization in Regression

This directory contains a comprehensive tutorial on regularization techniques for regression models, including Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regularization.

## Overview

Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in regression models by adding penalty terms to the loss function. This tutorial explores various regularization methods, their mathematical foundations, and practical implementations using both custom code and scikit-learn.

## Contents

1. **Jupyter Notebook**: `04_Regularization.ipynb`
   - Comprehensive theoretical explanation
   - Step-by-step implementation examples
   - Visualizations and model evaluation

2. **Python Modules**:
   - `data.py`: Data generation, loading, and preprocessing functions
   - `model.py`: Regularized regression model implementations
   - `main.py`: Entry point for running the complete analysis pipeline

## Learning Objectives

By completing this tutorial, you will:
- Understand the concept of overfitting and why regularization is necessary
- Learn the mathematical foundations of Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regularization
- Implement regularized regression models from scratch
- Use scikit-learn to apply regularization techniques efficiently
- Gain experience in hyperparameter tuning for regularized models
- Understand how to interpret regularized model coefficients

## Key Concepts

1. **Overfitting and Bias-Variance Tradeoff**:
   - How complex models can fit noise in the training data
   - The balance between underfitting and overfitting

2. **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**:
   - Add the sum of squared coefficients as a penalty
   - Loss function: MSE + λ∑(βⱼ²)
   - Shrinks coefficients toward zero but rarely to exactly zero

3. **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**:
   - Add the sum of absolute coefficients as a penalty
   - Loss function: MSE + λ∑|βⱼ|
   - Can reduce coefficients to exactly zero, performing feature selection

4. **Elastic Net**:
   - Combines L1 and L2 penalties
   - Loss function: MSE + λ₁∑|βⱼ| + λ₂∑(βⱼ²)
   - Handles correlated features better than Lasso

5. **Hyperparameter Selection**:
   - Cross-validation techniques
   - Regularization path visualization
   - Grid search and random search strategies
