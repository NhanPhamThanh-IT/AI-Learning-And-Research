    "### Overview\n",
    "Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. It models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "For simple linear regression:\n",
    "y = β₀ + β₁x + ε\n",
    "\n",
    "For multiple linear regression:\n",
    "y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- y is the dependent variable (target)\n",
    "- x, x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ are independent variables (features)\n",
    "- β₀ is the y-intercept (bias term)\n",
    "- β₁, β₂, ..., βₙ are the coefficients (weights)\n",
    "- ε is the error term (residual)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Linear Regression\n",
    "1. **Simple Linear Regression**: Uses one independent variable to predict a dependent variable.\n",
    "2. **Multiple Linear Regression**: Uses multiple independent variables to predict a dependent variable.\n",
    "3. **Polynomial Regression**: A form of linear regression where the relationship between x and y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.\n",
    "4. **Ridge Regression**: Adds L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "5. **Lasso Regression**: Adds L1 regularization which can lead to feature selection.\n",
    "6. **Elastic Net**: Combines both L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Assumptions\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between features and target is linear.\n",
    "2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance in errors across all levels of independent variables.\n",
    "4. **Normality**: Residuals follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "5. **No or little multicollinearity**: Independent variables are not highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimation Method\n",
    "The most common method to estimate parameters is Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), which minimizes the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values:\n",
    "min Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "1. **R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)**: Proportion of variance explained by the model (0-1).\n",
    "2. **Adjusted R-squared**: R-squared adjusted for the number of predictors.\n",
    "3. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "4. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE.\n",
    "5. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Considerations\n",
    "- Feature scaling/normalization is often beneficial but not strictly necessary\n",
    "- Handle missing values and outliers appropriately\n",
    "- Consider feature engineering to capture non-linear relationships\n",
    "- Validate assumptions before interpreting the model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- Simple to understand and implement\n",
    "- Computationally efficient\n",
    "- Highly interpretable (coefficients directly represent feature importance)\n",
    "- Works well with large datasets\n",
    "- Provides confidence intervals and prediction intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- Assumes linear relationship between variables\n",
    "- Sensitive to outliers\n",
    "- May underperform with highly non-linear data\n",
    "- Cannot handle irrelevant features well without regularization\n",
    "- Assumes independence among features (multicollinearity issues)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "- Economics (demand prediction)\n",
    "- Finance (asset pricing)\n",
    "- Biology (growth rates)\n",
    "- Real estate (house price prediction)\n",
    "- Marketing (sales forecasting)"
