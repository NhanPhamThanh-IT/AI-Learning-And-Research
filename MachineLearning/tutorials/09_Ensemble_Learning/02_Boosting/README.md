# Boosting

## Introduction
Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that aims to create a strong classifier from a number of weak classifiers. It works by training models sequentially, each one focusing more on the errors of the previous models. Boosting is highly effective for both classification and regression tasks.

## Theoretical Background
Boosting algorithms build models in sequence. Each new model attempts to correct the mistakes of the previous models by giving more weight to misclassified data points. The final prediction is a weighted combination of the predictions from all models.

### Steps of Boosting:
1. Train a base model on the data.
2. Increase the weight of misclassified samples.
3. Train the next model on the re-weighted data.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for a set number of iterations.
5. Aggregate the predictions (weighted vote or sum).

## Popular Boosting Algorithms
- **AdaBoost**: Adjusts weights of misclassified samples and combines weak learners.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Fits new models to the residuals of previous models.
- **XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost**: Efficient, scalable implementations for large datasets.

## Example
In AdaBoost, each weak learner is a shallow decision tree. After each round, the weights of misclassified samples are increased so that the next tree focuses more on those samples.

## Applications
- Classification and regression
- Ranking problems
- Outlier detection
- Time series forecasting

## Advantages
- Can significantly improve accuracy
- Reduces both bias and variance
- Works well with many types of base learners

## Disadvantages
- Sensitive to noisy data and outliers
- Can overfit if not properly regularized
- More complex and computationally intensive than bagging

## Comparison with Other Ensemble Methods
- **Bagging**: Reduces variance by training models in parallel on bootstrap samples.
- **Voting**: Combines predictions from different model types.
- **Stacking**: Uses a meta-model to combine base model predictions.
