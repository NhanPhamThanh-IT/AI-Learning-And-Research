# Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. To find a local minimum of a function using gradient descent, one takes steps proportional to the negative of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point.

## Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize the parameters (weights and biases) randomly.
2. Choose a learning rate (alpha) and a number of iterations.
3. In each iteration:
   a. Compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters.
   b. Update the parameters using the formula: `parameters = parameters - learning_rate * gradient`
4. Repeat until the number of iterations is reached or convergence is achieved.

## Key Concepts

- **Learning Rate**: Determines the size of the steps taken towards the minimum. A small learning rate can lead to slow convergence, while a large learning rate can cause the algorithm to overshoot the minimum or even diverge.
- **Cost Function (Loss Function)**: A function that measures the error between the predicted output and the actual output. The goal of gradient descent is to minimize this function.
- **Gradient**: The vector of partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to each parameter. It points in the direction of the steepest increase of the function.

## Advantages

- Simple to understand and implement.
- Effective for many types of problems.

## Disadvantages

- Can be slow for large datasets.
- Can get stuck in local minima.
- Sensitive to the choice of learning rate.
- Requires calculating the gradient of the entire dataset for each update (Batch Gradient Descent).
