## Overview

Optimization functions are the backbone of training machine learning models. They determine how the model's parameters are updated to minimize the error (loss) between predicted and actual outputs. This tutorial series explores several key optimization algorithms, from basic Gradient Descent to more advanced methods.

Each subdirectory focuses on a specific optimization algorithm and typically includes:
- `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the algorithm, theory, and usage.
- `data.py`: Code for data generation or loading.
- `model.py`: Implementation of the function to be optimized or the model architecture.
- `main.py`: Script to demonstrate the optimization process.

## Learning Objectives

By working through these tutorials, you will:
- Understand the core principles of gradient-based optimization.
- Learn how different optimization algorithms update model parameters.
- Explore the trade-offs between different optimization methods (e.g., convergence speed, memory usage).
- Gain practical experience implementing and using optimization algorithms.
- Understand concepts like learning rate, momentum, and Hessian approximation.

## Algorithms Covered

- **Gradient Descent**: The foundational algorithm that iteratively moves towards the minimum of a function by following the negative of the gradient.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: A variation of Gradient Descent that uses a single random training example at each step to compute the gradient, making it faster for large datasets but with more noisy updates.
- **L-BFGS**: A limited-memory quasi-Newton method that approximates the Hessian matrix to find the direction of descent, often converging faster than gradient descent methods for certain types of problems.
- **Momentum**: An extension to Gradient Descent that accelerates optimization by adding a fraction of the previous update vector to the current update, helping to navigate flat areas and reduce oscillations.
- **Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)**: A refinement of Momentum that calculates the gradient not at the current position, but at a position slightly ahead in the direction of the momentum, leading to faster convergence.
