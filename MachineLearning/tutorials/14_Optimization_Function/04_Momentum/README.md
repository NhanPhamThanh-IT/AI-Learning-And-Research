# Momentum

This directory contains a tutorial on the Momentum optimization algorithm. Momentum is an extension to the Gradient Descent algorithm that helps accelerate learning in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations.

It includes:
- Explanation of the Momentum algorithm and its benefits.
- Implementation of Gradient Descent with Momentum.
- Comparison with standard Gradient Descent.
