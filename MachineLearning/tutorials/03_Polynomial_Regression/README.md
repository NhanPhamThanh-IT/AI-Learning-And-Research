# Polynomial Regression Tutorial

This directory contains a comprehensive tutorial on Polynomial Regression, including theory, implementation, and practical applications.

## Overview

Polynomial Regression is an extension of linear regression that allows us to model non-linear relationships between variables. By adding polynomial terms to our linear regression model, we can fit curves to our data rather than straight lines. This tutorial provides an in-depth exploration of polynomial regression concepts, implementation approaches, and practical applications.

## Contents

1. **Jupyter Notebook**: `03_Polynomial_Regression.ipynb`
   - Comprehensive theoretical explanation
   - Step-by-step implementation examples
