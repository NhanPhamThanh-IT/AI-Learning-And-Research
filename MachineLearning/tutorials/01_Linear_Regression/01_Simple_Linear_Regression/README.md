# Linear Regression Tutorial

This directory contains a comprehensive tutorial on Linear Regression, covering both theoretical concepts and practical implementations.

## Overview

Linear Regression is one of the fundamental algorithms in machine learning, used for predicting continuous values based on one or more independent variables. This tutorial provides an in-depth exploration of linear regression, from basic concepts to practical implementation.

## Contents

1. **Jupyter Notebook**: `01_Linear_Regression.ipynb`
   - Comprehensive theoretical explanation
   - Step-by-step implementation examples
   - Visualizations and model evaluation

2. **Python Modules**:
   - `data.py`: Data generation, loading, and preprocessing functions
   - `model.py`: Linear regression model implementation from scratch
   - `main.py`: Entry point for running the complete analysis pipeline

## Learning Objectives

By completing this tutorial, you will:
- Understand the mathematical foundation of linear regression
- Learn how to implement linear regression from scratch
- Know how to use scikit-learn for efficient implementation
- Be able to evaluate and interpret regression models
- Gain practical experience with data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Understand the assumptions and limitations of linear regression

## Key Concepts

1. **Simple Linear Regression Formula**:
   - $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \varepsilon$
   - Where $\beta_0$ is the intercept and $\beta_1$ is the slope

2. **Cost Function**:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): $\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum (\hat{y} - y)^2$
   - Minimized to find optimal parameters

3. **Parameter Estimation**:
   - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
   - Gradient Descent optimization

4. **Assumptions**:
   - Linearity: The relationship between X and Y is linear
   - Independence: Observations are independent of each other
   - Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of residuals
   - Normality: Residuals are normally distributed

5. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - R-squared (Coefficient of determination)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with NumPy and Matplotlib
- Elementary knowledge of statistics and calculus
- Understanding of basic machine learning concepts

## Usage

1. Start with the Jupyter notebook for a guided tutorial
2. Explore the Python modules to understand the implementation details
3. Run the main.py script to execute the complete pipeline
4. Modify the code to experiment with different datasets or parameters
